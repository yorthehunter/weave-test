// Z-depth refers to the combination of z-index (layer level) and box-shadow that
// gives the element the visual feeling of being elevated.
// Controlling it this way makes sure we "layer" our elements correctly.
// $level corresponds to a change in "elevation," equivalent to z-index of 100,
// 200, 300, etc. respectively.
